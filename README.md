# Project Overview:
The code contained in this repository is designed to take an uncleaned .csv document from Zooniverse's citizen science project Microplants and outputs a cleaned datasheet that can be used for further analysis. 
Data is inputted via a web platform and in-museum kiosk at https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/fieldmuseumexhibits/microplants


### calculation_classes.py:
This file contains classes with methods that will:
- determine if two line segments intersect
- return the intersection point of two lines
- calculate the angle between two lines

### cleaning_script.py:
This file contains a functions that takes a .csv file as a parameter and returns a cleaned dataframe with the following 

### visualizations.py:
This file uses a cleaned dataframe to produce desired visualizations of classification data.
